# DVD-Rental-Company-Database
By Christian Dominguez, Austin Kodama,and Amy Dixon
The DVD Rental Company database will be storing information about movies that will be rented out DVDs. 
The database should be able to store data on what titles have been rented and are out of stock in the store and should also display which movies are still in stock at the store.
